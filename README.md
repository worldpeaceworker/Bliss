Bliss.social is a decentralized social media platform and CMS inspired by the peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture of BitTorrent. It empowers users to build, customize, and operate their own social networks while retaining full control over their data and interactions. With Bliss.social, your platform is entirely yours—secure, private, and censorship-resistant.

Project Overview

Bliss is an open-source, decentralized platform CMS that allows individuals, communities, and organizations to create, launch, and manage custom social media platforms. Whether for one person or a large community, Bliss enables users to build private or public spaces while seamlessly connecting with the larger Bliss network for shared content and interaction.

Bliss offers a unique blend of personalization and connectivity. Users can create platforms under a Bliss subdomain or their own custom domain, tailoring the experience to their specific needs. Even a single user can benefit from their own private social media platform, enjoying full customization while still accessing content shared publicly across the broader Bliss ecosystem.

Why Bliss?

The centralized social media model has failed to prioritize user needs, privacy, and control. Bliss.social redefines social networking by putting power back into the hands of users. No corporations own your data, no algorithms dictate your experience, and no single authority decides what you can or cannot share.  Bliss changes this dynamic by putting power back into users’ hands. Whether you’re an individual seeking a personal space to curate and share content or a large organization creating a branded social network, Bliss offers the tools to build platforms on your terms.



Bliss empowers:
	•	Individuals: Create private or public platforms for self-expression and personalized content sharing.
	•	Communities: Foster connections in spaces designed around shared interests and values.
	•	Businesses: Establish secure, branded platforms for customers and employees.
	•	Innovators: Explore new possibilities in decentralized, customizable social networking.

Bliss’s integration with the broader network ensures users benefit from both independence and community, creating a harmonious balance between individuality and connectivity.

Build your platform. Connect your world. Own your data.
